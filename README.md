 - Apply database updates by running `php bin/magento setup:upgrade` \*

### Decide which products can be bought with Flex Shopper

Each product will have "FlexShopper Leasing Enabled" Yes/No attribute:

![Product](doc/prod.png?raw=true "Product.png")

You must set this to "Yes" for all products that can be paid with FlexShopper.

### Conditions for the FlexShopper payment method to show in the frontend

- the Payment method must be enabled in the admin
- *all* products in the shopping cart must have "FlexShopper Leasing Enabled" set to "Yes"
- the order must be over the minimum order amount that was agreed with FlexShopper
- no product in the cart must trigger a backorder
- the API keys must be set and be valid
- if country restriction is enabled, FlexShopper only does business inside the United States


### View the FlexShopper payment method in the fronted

If all above conditions match, the payment method will appear in the frontend and will trigger a popup that will guide the customer in getting a lease and completing the payment:

 ![Payment 2](doc/p2.png?raw=true "P2.png")
 ![Payment 1](doc/p1.png?raw=true "P1.png")


### Order processing

The order view screen will list the FlexShopper payment method:

 ![Order View](doc/order_view.png?raw=true "order_view.png")
 
### Other integration points


The following actions will communicate with FlexShopper, in addition to order placing:

- Cancelling an order will send the cancellation to FlexShopper
- Shipping an order (fully or partially) will send the information to FlexShopper
- (Commerce only) Marking a return as "Received" send the return information to FlexShopper

## Limitations

- The payment method only works in the frontend one page checkout.
- Mixed carts (FlexShopper enabled + FlexShopper disabled products) are not supported. In this case, the payment method will not show.
- No invoice will be created for Flex Shopper orders and in case the merchant needs a payment document in Magento, they have to manually do it upon payment from FlexShopper, as there is no automated way of getting notified.
